```bash
npm install @react-three/a11y
```

`@react-three/a11y` brings accessibility to WebGL, with easy to use components [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) components to enable focus indication, keyboard tab navigation, and screen reader support.

# How to use

First, place the `A11yAnnouncer` component next to the R3F Canvas component. This is critical, because it will manage the screen-reader and help emulate focus!

```jsx
import { A11yAnnouncer } from '@react-three/a11y'

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Canvas />
      <A11yAnnouncer />
    </>
  )
}
```

To add some accessibility features to your scene you'll have to wrap objects you want to make focusable with the `A11y` component:

```jsx
import { A11y } from '@react-three/a11y'

<A11y>
  <MyComponent />
</A11y>
```

At this point both `MyComponent` can receive focus. More accurately, the emulated "focus" will be on the parent `A11y` that will act as a provider and let its children access its state. But even if objects are focusable, nothing will be displayed or read without a few more attributes.

## Accessing the hover, focused & pressed state

For each child wrapped in a `A11y` component, you can access the `focus` / `hover` / `pressed` state like so:

```jsx
import { useA11y } from '@react-three/a11y'

function Box(props) {
  //useA11y gives us access to hover, focus and pressed states
  const a11y = useA11y()
  return (
    <mesh {...props}>
      <boxBufferGeometry />
      <meshStandardMaterial color={a11y.hover || a11y.focus ? 'hotpink' : 'orange'} />
    </mesh>
  )
}
```

## The role attribute

Like in HTML, you can focus different kind of elements and expect different things depending on what you're focusing:

- `role="content"` ( default ) <a href="/#content">More below </a>
- `role="button"` <a href="/#button">More below </a>
- `role="link"` <a href="/#link">More below </a>

## Call function on focus

The `focusCall` prop of `A11y` will be called each time this component receives focus (usually through tab navigation).

```jsx
<A11y role="content" focusCall={()=> console.log("in focus")} ... />
```

## Call function on click / keyboard Click

The `actionCall` prop of `A11y` will be called each time this component gets clicked, focused, keyboard activated etc.

```jsx
<A11y role="button" actionCall={()=> console.log("clicked")} ... />
```

## Provide a description of the currenlty focused / hovered element

When using the `description` prop, the `A11y` component will provide a description to the screen reader users on focus/hover.
Optionally, you can also show the description to the user on hover by setting `showAltText={true}`.

```jsx
// Reads "A rotating red square" to screen readers on focus / hover
<A11y role="content" description="A rotating red square" ... />
// Reads "A bouncing blue sphere" to screen readers on focus / hover while also showing it on mouseover
<A11y role="content" description="A bouncing blue sphere" showAltText ... />
```

If your `A11y` component has the `role="button"`, you can use three more props:

- `activationMsg`: When the user will click/activate the "button" the screen reader will read the passed message
- `deactivationMsg`: When set, it turns your button in a togglable button. Which means it now has a on/off state. Screen readers will read the state of the button as well as the activation/disactivation messages passsed.
- `pressedDescription`: When set, it turns your button in a togglable button. Which means it now has a on/off state. This description will replace the one passed via `description` when the toggle is active.

```jsx
// Reads the description on hover/focus then will read activationMsg if clicked/pressed
<A11y role="button" description="Sends a thank you email to the team" activationMsg="Email is sending" ... />
// Reads the description on hover/focus then will read activationMsg if turned on or deactivationMsg if tuned off
<A11y
  role="button"
  description="This button can enable dark theme. Dark theme is off"
  pressedDescription="This button can disable dark theme. Dark theme is on"
  activationMsg="Dark theme enabled"
  deactivationMsg="Dark theme disabled"
  ... />
```

## The three roles of the `A11y` component

#### `content`

`cursor: default`
This role is meant to provide information to screen readers or to serve as a step for a user to navigate your site using Tab for instance.
It's not meant to trigger anything on click or to be activable with the Keyboard.
Therefore it won't show a pointer cursor on hover.

#### `button`

`cursor: pointer`
Special attributes : activationMsg, deactivationMsg, pressedDescription
This role is meant to emulate the behaviour of a button or a togglable button.
It will display a cursor pointer when your cursor is over the linked 3D object.
It will call a function on click but also on any kind of action that would trigger a focused button ( Enter, Double-Tap .. )
It is also actionnable by user using a screen reader.
You can turn it into a button with aria-pressed by providing the following properties deactivationMsg, pressedDescription in addition to the usual description and activationMsg properties.

#### `link`

`cursor: pointer`
`special attributes : href`
This role is meant to emulate the behaviour of a regular html link.
It should be used in combination with something that will trigger navigation on click.
Just like the button one, it is accessible to all kind of user.

```diff
- Don't forget to provide the href attribute as he is required for screen readers to read it correctly !
- It will have no effect on the navigation, it's just used as information
```

## Screen Reader Support

In order to provide informations to screen reader users and use this package at its full potential, fill the `description` prop of all your `A11y` components and use the appropriate `role` prop on each of them.

## Additionals Features

Use a custom tabindex with for your A11y components by providing a number to the tabIndex attribute

```jsx
<A11y tabIndex={2} ... />
```

## Next Steps

- [ ] Improve the accessibility for mobile screen readers such as Voice Over and Talk Back
- [ ] Provide a documentation inside the IDE
